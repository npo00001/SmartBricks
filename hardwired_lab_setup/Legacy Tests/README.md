### `max31856_test_k_thermocouple.ino`

**Purpose:**  
Test sketch for reading temperature from a K-type thermocouple using the Adafruit MAX31856 amplifier.

**Details:**
- Uses software SPI (pins 10â€“13) to interface with the breakout board
- Reads both cold junction and thermocouple tip temperatures
- Converts values to degrees Fahrenheit
- Detects and reports common faults (open circuit, over/under voltage, temperature range errors)

**Note:**  
This sketch was used to verify thermocouple amplifier behavior early in the project. In the final implementation, thermocouple inputs were emulated using direct analog voltages for simplicity.

## Future Use

If future SmartBricks versions require accurate thermocouple support:
- Use this sketch to validate MAX31856 operation
- Adapt it into the I2C sensor node framework to integrate with the hub system
- Compare results with emulated analog sensors to evaluate performance benefits
